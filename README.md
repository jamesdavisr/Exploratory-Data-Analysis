# 🎶 Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023: Exploratory Data Analysis 🎶

This project was developed as part of the Electronics Engineering program at the **University of Santo Tomas**. Here, we analyze Spotify's most-streamed songs of 2023, diving into patterns, trends, and insights to understand the characteristics of popular music. Using Python and key data analysis tools, we explore what makes these tracks resonate with listeners worldwide.

## 📊 Project Overview

This exploratory data analysis (EDA) seeks to uncover:
- The common attributes among the most-streamed songs.
- Artists and genres that dominated 2023.
- Relationships between song characteristics such as danceability, energy, and tempo.

### Repository Contents
1. A **Jupyter Notebook** with step-by-step analysis, visualizations, and interpretations.
2. Clean and well-organized **Python scripts** for reproducible analysis.
3. A detailed **README** explaining insights, methods, and project structure.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **`Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the main analysis and visualizations.
- **`Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023.py`**: Python script with core data processing and visualization functions.
- **`README.md`**: This document, providing an overview and guide for the project.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

This project was created using:
- **Python** (3.8 or higher)
- **Pandas**: for data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: for visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook**: for interactive exploration

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jamesdavisr/Exploratory-Data-Analysis.git
    cd Most-Streamed-Spotify-Songs-2023
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook** to view and interact with the analysis:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Most\ Streamed\ Spotify\ Songs\ 2023.ipynb
    ```

## 📈 Analysis Highlights

### 1. Top Artists & Genres of 2023
   - **Top Artists**: Analysis of featured artists shows who led in 2023 Spotify streams.
   - **Genres**: A breakdown of song genres reveals popular music trends among listeners.

### 2. Song Attributes
   - **Danceability, Energy, and Tempo**: Attributes like danceability and energy often correlate with higher streaming numbers.
   - **Popularity**: We explore what features top songs have in common, offering insights into the metrics behind song success.

### 3. Key Insights & Visualizations
   - **Stream Counts & Popularity**: Scatter plots and bar charts visualize the relationship between streaming numbers and song characteristics.
   - **Artist Dominance**: Visualizations illustrate which artists led the charts in 2023.

## 📑 Key Findings

- **Popularity vs. Energy**: Songs with higher energy levels are often associated with higher streams, though this alone isn’t a guarantee of success.
- **Artist Dominance**: A few top artists capture most of the streams, highlighting strong fan bases and mainstream appeal.
- **Genre Trends**: Genres such as Pop and Hip-Hop have particularly high popularity, reflecting current listener preferences.
